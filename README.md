# Building an App UI with PrimeFaces [Video]
This is the code repository for [SQL Server 2016 Database Reporting [Video]](https://prod.packtpub.com/in/big-data-and-business-intelligence/sql-server-2016-database-reporting-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
PrimeFaces is a leading frontend framework that helps you build a user interface which is flexible without a fuss. It's one of the fastest ways to create great looking and fully functional websites. When coupled with JavaServer Faces (JSF) you will be able to not only create websites very quickly, but also ones that are extensible and maintainable. 

The tutorial starts off with configuring the required components: PrimeFaces, NetBeans, MongoDB, MongoVUE, JSF, and Spring. You then go on to develop a very basic JSF and PrimeFaces UI for your website using Spring and Mongo running on a Tomcat server. Next you will upgrade the website using more features like the creation of the data administration pages and securing the administration pages. Finally you will use CSS and JSF templates to finish off a functional database-driven website with a beautiful and neat interface. 

This set of videos will show you how to take full advantage of PrimeFaces by coupling it with JSF, Spring, and MongoDB to create a user interface that meets your demands of flexibility and extensibility.
